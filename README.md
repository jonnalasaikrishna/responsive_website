mockup as a PDF-file, and you must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You
will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to
each of the portfolio projects you will complete through the course of your
Nanodegree program. Please note that while you should aim to recreate the
mockup, you may also use your own custom images to personalize this project.

## Technology required:

### HTML
### CSS

## process:

1. Write your HTML and CSS files, continue to iterate until your work is representative of
the design mockup.
2. Take the time to personalize your portfolio with custom colors, additional content and
your own images.
